# SnakeRL

**SnakeRL** is a reinforcement learning project focused on training an agent to play the classic Snake game using Python.

## Project Structure

- `SnakeEnv.py`: Defines the Snake game environment compatible with reinforcement learning algorithms.
- `agent.py`: Contains the implementation of the RL agent responsible for learning and decision-making.
- `model.py`: Defines the neural network architecture used by the agent.
- `training/`: Directory containing scripts and configurations for training the RL agent.
- `model/`: Directory designated for saving trained models.
- `demo.py`: Script to demonstrate the trained agent playing the Snake game.
